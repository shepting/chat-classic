# macOS 10.2 Jaguar - AppKit Features (August 2002)

## Overview
macOS 10.2 Jaguar introduced significant refinements to the Aqua interface and several important AppKit enhancements, building on the foundation established in 10.0 and 10.1.

## Key AppKit Features

### NSTableView Enhancements
- **Improved column resizing**: Better column width management and user interaction
- **Enhanced sorting support**: Built-in column header sorting indicators and callbacks
- **Table column autosaving**: Automatic persistence of column widths and positions
- **Better keyboard navigation**: Improved arrow key navigation and selection handling
- **Row height customization**: Support for variable row heights in table views

### NSOutlineView Improvements
- **Disclosure triangle refinements**: Better visual feedback for expandable items
- **Improved indentation**: More consistent and visually appealing item hierarchy display
- **Enhanced drag and drop**: Better support for reordering outline view items
- **Keyboard expansion/collapse**: Spacebar and arrow key support for outline navigation

### Window Management
- **Enhanced NSSplitView**: Improved split view divider behavior and appearance
- **Window shadows**: System-wide drop shadows for all windows (Quartz Extreme)
- **Better window resizing**: Improved live resize performance and visual feedback
- **Toolbar enhancements**: More flexible toolbar customization options

### Sidebar-Related Features
- **NSBrowser improvements**: Enhanced browser view for hierarchical navigation
- **Better column view support**: Foundation for modern sidebar-style navigation
- **Drawer enhancements**: Improved NSDrawer behavior and animations (though drawers later deprecated)

### Graphics and Rendering
- **Quartz Extreme**: Hardware-accelerated window compositing (on supported hardware)
- **Anti-aliased text**: System-wide text smoothing improvements
- **Enhanced bezier paths**: Better NSBezierPath performance and capabilities
- **Improved image rendering**: Better NSImage scaling and display

### Controls and UI Elements
- **Refined Aqua appearance**: Subtle improvements to button and control appearance
- **Enhanced NSPopUpButton**: Better popup button behavior and styling
- **Improved NSTabView**: Enhanced tab view appearance and functionality
- **Better focus rings**: More consistent focus indication across controls

## Developer Impact

### NSTableView/NSOutlineView Development
- More robust data source protocols
- Better performance with large data sets
- Enhanced delegate methods for customization
- Improved selection and highlighting behavior

### Window Layout
- Better support for complex window layouts
- Improved auto-layout foundations (precursor to Auto Layout)
- Enhanced split view behavior for sidebar-style interfaces
- Better window animation and effects support

## Notable Limitations
- No formal sidebar API yet (introduced later in 10.5+)
- Limited theming support compared to later versions
- Some visual inconsistencies in complex table/outline hierarchies
- Drawer-based navigation still preferred over embedded sidebars

## Legacy Compatibility Notes
When targeting 10.2 for legacy applications:
- Use NSOutlineView for hierarchical sidebar content
- Implement manual column management for NSTableView
- Handle window layout programmatically without modern constraints
- Use NSBrowser for file system navigation interfaces
