# macOS 10.3 Panther - AppKit Features (October 2003)

## Overview
macOS 10.3 Panther brought significant user interface refinements and introduced several foundational technologies that would shape future macOS development, including improved window management and table view capabilities.

## Major AppKit Features

### NSTableView Enhancements
- **Variable row heights**: Native support for rows with different heights in the same table
- **Improved cell editing**: Better in-place editing experience with enhanced text field behavior
- **Enhanced selection model**: More sophisticated multi-selection and range selection capabilities
- **Better scrolling performance**: Optimized rendering for large data sets
- **Column header improvements**: Enhanced column header appearance and interaction
- **Table view alternating row colors**: Built-in support for zebra-striped table backgrounds

### NSOutlineView Improvements  
- **Smoother animations**: Enhanced expand/collapse animations for outline items
- **Better indentation control**: More precise control over item indentation levels
- **Improved item badge support**: Better visual indicators for outline view items
- **Enhanced drag and drop**: More robust drag and drop reordering capabilities
- **Keyboard navigation**: Improved arrow key and type-ahead selection

### Window and Layout Management
- **Enhanced NSSplitView**: Significant improvements to split view divider behavior
  - Smoother resizing animations
  - Better minimum/maximum size constraints
  - Improved visual feedback during resize
- **Window exposé integration**: AppKit windows work seamlessly with new Exposé feature
- **Fast user switching support**: Windows properly hide/show during user switching
- **Improved window shadows**: More realistic and performance-optimized drop shadows

### Sidebar and Navigation
- **NSBrowser enhancements**: Improved column-based navigation
  - Better column width management
  - Enhanced selection appearance
  - Improved keyboard navigation
- **Drawer refinements**: Enhanced NSDrawer animation and positioning
- **Source list foundations**: Early groundwork for what would become source lists (formal API in 10.5)

### Graphics and Rendering
- **PDF Kit introduction**: NSPDFImageRep and basic PDF rendering support
- **Improved Quartz rendering**: Better performance for complex graphics
- **Enhanced image processing**: Improved NSImage scaling and effects
- **Better font rendering**: Refined text appearance and performance

### Controls and Interface Elements
- **Refined Aqua controls**: Updated appearance for buttons, sliders, and other controls
- **Enhanced NSSearchField**: Introduction of the modern search field control
- **Improved NSPopUpButton**: Better popup menu behavior and appearance
- **NSLevelIndicator**: New level indicator control for progress/rating display

## Developer Impact

### Table and Outline Views
- More powerful data source and delegate protocols
- Better performance optimization options
- Enhanced customization capabilities for cell rendering
- Improved accessibility support

### Window Layout Strategies
- Split view layouts become more practical for complex interfaces
- Better foundation for sidebar-style applications
- Improved window management for document-based apps
- Enhanced support for auxiliary panels and inspectors

### Interface Design Patterns
- Column-based navigation (NSBrowser) more refined
- Drawer-based supplementary content still prevalent
- Foundation laid for future source list patterns
- Better integration with system-wide UI conventions

## Notable Features for Legacy Development

### NSTableView Best Practices (10.3)
```objc
// Variable row height support
- (CGFloat)tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView heightOfRow:(NSInteger)row;

// Enhanced selection handling
- (BOOL)tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView shouldSelectRow:(NSInteger)row;

// Improved cell customization
- (void)tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView 
   willDisplayCell:(id)cell 
    forTableColumn:(NSTableColumn *)tableColumn 
               row:(NSInteger)row;
```

### Sidebar-Style Layouts
- Use NSSplitView with NSOutlineView for hierarchical navigation
- NSBrowser for file system or nested category browsing
- NSDrawer for supplementary content (though later deprecated)

## Limitations and Considerations
- No formal "source list" appearance yet (introduced in 10.5)
- Limited animation capabilities compared to later versions
- Drawer-based designs still preferred over embedded sidebars
- Some accessibility features still developing

## Legacy Compatibility Notes
When targeting 10.3 for legacy applications:
- Take advantage of variable row heights for rich table content
- Use enhanced NSSplitView for better sidebar layouts
- Implement proper delegate methods for improved table performance
- Consider NSBrowser for hierarchical data navigation
- Use NSSearchField for modern search interfaces
